### ScriptReports.jl

ScriptReports.jl is a Julia package that allows you to create reports using Julia scripts using a combination of [Literate.jl](https://github.com/fredrikekre/Literate.jl) and [Weave.jl](https://github.com/JunoLab/Weave.jl). [LiterateWeave.jl](https://github.com/baggepinnen/LiterateWeave.jl) does something similar, but I added a few more features including hiding source code and using ```<details>``` blocks. 

See the ```examples``` folder for a quick tutorial.
